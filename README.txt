The front end is going to be set-up using the REACT framework. 
Any changes needed to the client side of the web app can be implemented within the Finalpjt/frontend/finalpjt folder.
In the REACT framework scripting is done using the App.jsx file, from my understanding
I will update this file if I find otherwise.

To start, use 'npm run dev'

if any questions ask me!
